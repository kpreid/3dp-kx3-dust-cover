This is a 3D-printable dust cover for the [Elecraft](https://elecraft.com/) KX3 radio transceiver.

It was designed as a dust cover only; if you intend to use it to protect the panel for transporting the radio I recommend increasing wall thicknesses.

There are two printing options:

* `kx3-dust-cover` is a plain unmarked cover.
* `kx3-dust-cover-mm-body` and `kx3-dust-cover-mm-label` may be used in multimaterial printing to display “KX3” across the face.
